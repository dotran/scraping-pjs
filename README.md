# Web Scraping Using Python and PhantomJS

This is a starter kit for developing web scrapers using Python and PhantomJS. The point is to make scraping pages with JavaScript a breeze. The initial inspiration came from a [post][1] by techstonia.

The script was written for Python 3 and should work on both Linux and Windows by calling
 
 ```bash
 $ python scraper.py
 ```
 
 or
 
 ```bash
 $ ./scraper.py
 ```
